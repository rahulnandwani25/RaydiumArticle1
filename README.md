# **The Raydium Protocol: An AMM For The Future**

Rahul Nandwani May 21st 2021



Amidst a largely volatile month for crypto, there seems to be a ray of hope amongst the rubble. Solana summer is impending and along with it comes Raydium. Raydium protocol is an automated market maker (AMM), built on the sturdy foundations of the Solana blockchain. An automated market maker is a form of decentralized exchange (DEX) that relies on a mathematical formula to price assets (Binance Academy, 2021). Market making in the traditional sense is normally conducted by organisations with heavy funding and intricate strategies. On an order book exchange, market makers assist customers in obtaining a fair price and a narrow bid-ask range. Conversely, automated market makers democratize the process, giving anyone access to building a market on the blockchain. 

The current DeFi token exchange offerings that exist on the Ethereum blockchain bring with them a host of concerns. Foremost are the long repeated concerns of high gas fees. This was most recently observed during the 19th of May’s crypto crash. Gas fees rose to almost 1500 Gwei for basic transactions and surged to almost 4500 Gwei for complex multiple contract transactions (Rustgi, 2021). For comparison, gas fees usually cost from 40 to 100 Gwei. Additionally, as users on the blockchain increase exponentially, this jams the blockchain network and slows the speed of transactions. Traditional AMMs offer a way to set the number of tokens to be traded and a slippage value (Raydium, 2021). Order and gas fees will be exhausted if the stringent requirements are not met and have led to a decrease in limit orders. The majority of AMMs have clashing offerings and traders are usually negatively affected by slippage if liquidity providers have preferences for respective AMMs. With the ease in limit orders, comes the ease in flow trading allowing savvy investors to ride the wave, by buying low and selling high like a blockchain beach.

### Swaps

Raydium strives to solve the problems AMMs currently face using several strategies. They leverage the central order book of the Serum decentralized exchange (DEX) to enable lightning-fast trades, shared liquidity and new features for earning yield (Raydium, 2021). This innovatively combines the best of AMMs such as a simple interface for liquidity providing and earning yields but using Serum and order books on Solana which is possible due to its high scalability. The underlying issue with swaps is when one attempts to quickly get in on a trade and the price moves out of the slippage. After waiting fifteen minutes, the transaction fails. In such an instance does the order book feature play an integral role as one can see exactly what orders are available and can set the price higher. This allows one to capitalise on those orders faster due to the added transparency with the added utility of Ray tokens, which will reward those who gain and hold it.

### Liquidity Pools

Raydium also supports a host of several other features apart from swaps such as liquidity pools, farming, staking and the AcceleRaytor. In the case of their pools, Raydium extracts the tokens users place into liquidity pools and refocuses them onto the order books as limit orders. Generally, these limit orders work as market-making orders, similar to those that sit on the order books to allow for easily accessible liquidity for other users to benefit from. These orders are spaced out with an ample bid-ask spread. This spread is usually a better offer in comparison to Serum’s other market makers. These are calculated utilising the K= Y*X equation. Upon doing so, Raydium bestows similar liquidity to the largest market makers such as Uniswap or Sushi for the exact trading prices. This is a comprehensive solution to a tedious problem as it provides limitless liquidity for any price point. In essence, liquidity is provided for any price. On the contrary, such flexibility brings some downsides as well. Trading stablecoins such as USDC/ USDT is difficult as liquidity is not prevalent closer to the centre of the order book.

### AcceleRaytor

Prior to Permissionless Pools, Raydium’s AcceleRaytor was also integral in showcasing their dedication to contributing to the overall Solana blockchain. The system, which includes the Community and RAY pool process, will enable ventures to expand their scope and grow at a faster rate as it removes the closed-door veil usually existing. Community pools, although project specifications can influence participation and eligibility, are allocated for members of the ecosystem regardless of their affinity to Raydium. RAY pools, on the other hand, are aimed at individuals who actively participate in Raydium’s community. This requires users to stake an amount of RAY in the RAY.staking pool. This double-tiered approach simultaneously remunerates active Raydium community members and maintains an open contribution to the wider ecosystem. Fundamentally, it allows communities themselves to fund the growth of promising projects, while concurrently channelling liquidity. They can “AcceleRayte” the growth of promising ventures to potentially IDO quicker than usual. 

### Fusion Pools & Permissionless Pools

Apart from the speed and cost rhetoric usually used in explaining the benefits of farming on Solana based projects, Raydium also has huge momentum behind it to take advantage of. On April 11 just a few weeks after its launch, Raydium had hundreds of millions of liquidity locked up in its pools (McCann, 2021). One of Raydium's farming trademarks is its concept of “Fusion Pools”. Fusion pools is where one can earn a dual yield on the two different coins to be staked (McCann, 2021). Yield farmers will be able to receive double the rewards in the form of both RAY and the project token being farmed in the pool. At the time of writing, Raydium has just released its new liquidity pool feature titled “Permissionless Pools”. Permissionless liquidity pools essentially allow any project or user to create an AMM Pool that is tradeable on Raydium and also provides liquidity to the Serum order book (Raydium Twitter, 2021). This is to cater to the massive exodus of new projects springing up on the Solana blockchain. The talent incubated from the Solana Season Hackathon and the recently released CoinDCX x DevFolio’s Indian hackathon will fuel the rise in innovative projects. This will open up and allow for greater autonomy for teams to power liquidity for Raydium and Serum for a mutually beneficial process.

## Tokenomics

RAY is the native utility token used for:

* Staking to earn protocol fees
* Staking to receive IDO allocations
* Governance votes on protocol decisions

Raydium launched its main net on February 21st, 2021 with 555,000,000 tokens created at genesis. 34% of all tokens will be released as liquidity mining incentives over a 3-year period. 30% of tokens are earmarked for partnerships and the expansion of the Raydium ecosystem. This includes giving grants to projects building projects around Raydium or helping our communities in general. These tokens are generally locked for 1 year and unlock linearly for the next 2 years.

## **Team**

In the crypto world where founders like Vitalik Buterin are lauded with a mass following, the team behind Raydium is an ostentatious one. With their Ray-Esque name format, it is clear the team consisting of XRay, StingRay, GammaRay and RayZor led by the inconspicuous AlphaRay aim to determine their value through the quality of their platform. AlphaRay, who leads overall strategy, operations, product direction and business development for Raydium, began investing in crypto in December 2017 upon learning from a friend of its sheer potential. AlphaRay swiftly caught wind of the famous “Kimchi Arbitrage” and thereafter spent countless trips to and from Korea, profiting from the move. He then went on to conduct yield farming on AMMs such as Sushi and profited again from the arbitrage off these platforms. 


 Fast forward to September 2021, gas prices started increasing incrementally and costed almost $100 to conduct even the most basic transactions such as swapping tokens etc. AlphaRay’s inspired belief was that crypto’s low barrier was meant to bring higher accessibility and was frustrated that individuals were getting priced out due to huge gas fees. He set out to change the status quo and gave a call to the team at FTX, as one does. Upon being told of “Serum”, their new project at the embryonic stage, he had a lightbulb moment. Inspired by Serum’s order book, it rapidly dawned on AlphaRay how ideal it was for AMMs and the trading interface for users that gave them more control than just conducting swaps. During the DeFi summer of 2020, he set out to assemble a crack team of developers to tackle the problem and avenge (pardon the reference) the ecosystem head-on. Much like a Marvel movie, he consolidated an all-star team with experience ranging from trading and low latency systems architects to leading data analytics and market research firms. And thus, Raydium was born.

## **Roadmap**

In an exclusive conversation with Solasystem, Raydium has highlighted several items to be released in the next few quarters. The team aims to release stable swaps and governance in Q3, however has duly noted if things were to go smoothly, they could release them as early as Q2.

With exciting new concepts such as Project Raydiate and the Bonsai Sushiswap Integration, Raydium is showing no signs of slowing down. It is safe to say the path is set for Raydium to establish itself as one of the core protocols in the Solana ecosystem.
